        <p>The intelligence, it is the thing is the difference between human and the animals and every thing Allah create it, and the intelligence is the powerful of the human that make it controls in every thing in the world.<br>
            Now we know what is the intelligence and how have this intelligence, lets go to know what scientists define the intelligence:<br>
            Intelligence has been defined in many ways: capacity for logic , understanding , self-consciousness, learning, emotional knowledge, reasoning , planning, creativity , critical thinking and problem-solving. More broadly, it can be described as the ability to interpret or infer information, and retain it as knowledge to be applied in an environment or context to adaptive behavior.<br>
            Intelligence is most widely studied in humans but was also found in non-human animals as well as in plants.<br>
            But the human still dream, what if another creatures have this intelligence! Or what if we make robots with intelligence! And this robots make our life easier, and the humans still research about this thing until they make (artificial intelligence), the artificial intelligence it that we give intelligence to the robots to make many things to us with easier way.<br>
            And this is the topic that we talk today (artificial intelligence), we will talk about it in simple way , whatâ€™s its meaning and how it starts and what is the advantage of artificial intelligence and the disadvantages and the applications.
