        <h1>Definition of AI</h1>
        <p>In computer science, in contrast to the natural intelligence exhibited by humans and animals, artificial intelligence ( AI), also called machine intelligence, is intelligence displayed by machinery. Leading AI textbooks characterize the discipline as the study of "smart agents": any system that perceives its environment and takes action that maximizes its chance of achieving its goals.1) Colloquially, the word "artificial intelligence" is often used to describe machines (or computers) that imitate "cognitive" functions that humans associate with the human mind, such as "learning" .<br>
            As computers are increasingly capable, tasks considered to require "intelligence" are often omitted from the concept of AI, a trend known as the AI effect[3) A quip in Tesler 's Theorem says "AI is whatever hasn't been done yet. "4) For example, optical character recognition is often excluded from items deemed to be AI,5) having become a routine technology.<br>
            The history of artificial intelligence is very accident so it is very long.

        <h1>How AI started</h1>
        <p>For a long time there was the possibility of inanimate objects coming to life as human beings. The ancient Greeks had theories on machines, and automatons were designed by Chinese and Egyptian engineers.<br>
            Artificial Intelligence ( AI) history began in antiquity, with myths , stories, and rumors of artificial beings endowed by master craftsmen with intelligence or consciousness. The seeds of modern AI were planted by classical philosophers who tried to describe the process of human thinking as the manipulation of symbols by mechanism. This research culminated in the 1940s with the invention of the programmable digital computer, a system focused on mathematical reasoning's abstract nature.<br> 
            This system and the concepts behind it motivated a group of scientists to begin discussing the prospect of creating an artificial brain seriously.<br>
            The field of AI research was developed during the summer of 1956 at a workshop held on the Dartmouth College campus.1) Those who attended would become the pioneers in AI research for decades. Some of them believed there would be a computer as intelligent as a human being in little more than a century and millions of dollars were donated to make this dream come true.<br>
            Eventually it became clear that they had massively underestimated the project's complexity. In 1973, the U.S. and British Governments began funding undirected work into artificial intelligence in response to criticism from James Light hill and continuing pressure from Congress, and the tough years that followed would later be known as a "AI winter" Seven years later, the Japanese government's visionary initiative inspired governments and industry to provide AI with billions of dollars, but by the late 1980s investors became disillusioned and withdrew funding again.<br>
            Investment and interest in AI boomed in the first decades of the 21st century, when machine learning was successfully applied to many academic and industrial problems due to new methods, powerful computer hardware application, and huge data sets collection.
