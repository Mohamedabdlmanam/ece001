        <h1>Disadvantages of AI</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>Can cost much money and time to construct, restore, and repair, Robotic repair will occur to reduce time and it needs to be fixed by humans but it will take more money and resources.</li>
            <li>Is it questionable: is it morally and ethically correct to have androids, human-like robots or to replicate intelligence, a gift of nature that should not be recreated? This is a really common discussion about AI in the days.</li>
            <li>Storage is vast but access and retrieval cannot result in memory connections as well as humans may.</li>
            <li>When they are programmed to, they can learn and get better with jobs, but it's unclear if they will ever become as successful as humans do.</li>
            <li>They cannot function beyond what they've been trained to.</li>
            <li>They will never earn the imagination that humans have, or at least apparently never with our technical expectations. It may avoid the compassion for human interaction with feelings, such as becoming nurses. It can popular comprehension of experience, too.</li>
            <li>This may avoid the presence of common sense. Even if they are programmed with common sense and understanding, it seems impossible for them to get as much common sense as humans do.</li>
            <li>This can prevent sympathy for human contact with emotions such as being nurses, which can also reduce understanding of wisdom.</li>
            <li>That may prevent the occurrence of common sense. Even if they are coded with common sense and learning, it seems difficult for them to get as much common sense as humans could.</li>
            <li>Robots will lead to extreme unemployment, replacing workers with machines, unless people will solve unemployment with workers that AI can't do or turn the government to communism seriously.</li>
            <li>As already seen in part with smartphones and other technology, humans may become too reliant on AI and lose their mental ability.</li>
            <li>Machines can easily lead to destruction if they are put in the wrong hands, that is, at least many people's fear.</li>
            <li>AI will supersede humans as machines, enslaving us.</li>
        </ul>
